Very simple script that is meant to run from cron that generates
random tweets using dadadodo on a corpus of tweets gathered from its
followers

Dependencies:
- python-twitter http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/
- chrome compact language detector http://code.google.com/p/chromium-compact-language-detector/
- dadadodo (expected to be in /usr/bin/dadadodo) http://www.jwz.org/dadadodo/
